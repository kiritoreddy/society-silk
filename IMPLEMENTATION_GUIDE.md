# Cooperative Society Management System - Implementation Guide

## Overview

A comprehensive multi-society cooperative society management system built with React, TypeScript, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS. This system supports multiple cooperative societies with complete accounting, member management, loans, borrowings, inventory, and reporting capabilities.

## âœ… Completed Components

### 1. Database Schema (COMPLETE)
- **All tables created and configured** with proper relationships
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables

- Default account heads automatically created for new societies
- Comprehensive audit logging infrastructure

### 2. Core Infrastructure (COMPLETE)
- Authentication with Supabase (email/password)
- Multi-society context management
- Protected routes and role-based access control
- TypeScript types for all entities
- Configurable for both hosted and local PostgreSQL

### 3. User Interface Foundation (COMPLETE)
- Modern, responsive layout with sidebar navigation
- Authentication pages (Login/Register)
- Society selection and creation
- Dashboard with key metrics
- Reusable layout component (AppLayout)

### 4. Current Features
- âœ… User authentication and session management
- âœ… Multi-society support
- âœ… Society creation with automatic setup
- âœ… Role-based access control (Admin, Accounts, Auditor, Viewer)
- âœ… Dashboard with financial metrics
- âœ… Responsive navigation sidebar

## ðŸš§ Modules to Complete

The database schema and infrastructure are fully ready. The following UI modules need to be built:

### Priority 1: Core Accounting
1. **Members Management** - CRUD operations for society members
2. **Chart of Accounts** - View and manage account heads
3. **Voucher Creation** - Create vouchers with live balancing validation
4. **Day Book** - Dual-column format with Receipt/Payment sides

### Priority 2: Lending & Borrowing
5. **Loans Management** - Loan creation, disbursement, and repayment
6. **Borrowings Management** - Track borrowings from banks/institutions

### Priority 3: Inventory & Reports
7. **Inventory Management** - Item master, transactions, stock ledger
8. **Reports Module** - Ledger, Trial Balance, P&L, Balance Sheet
9. **Export Functionality** - PDF/Excel exports for Day Book and reports

## Database Configuration

### For Hosted Supabase (Default)
The system is already configured to work with hosted Supabase. The environment variables are set in `.env`:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://bibrhiszicwsquyhqvpz.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key>
```

### For Local PostgreSQL
To use a local PostgreSQL server:

1. Set up Supabase locally:
```bash
npx supabase init
npx supabase start
```

2. Update `.env` file:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-local-anon-key>
```

3. Run migrations:
```bash
npx supabase db push
```

## Database Schema Overview

### Core Accounting
- `account_heads` - Chart of accounts (Assets, Liabilities, Income, Expenditure)
- `vouchers` - Main voucher records with approval workflow
- `voucher_lines` - Individual debit/credit entries

### Members
- `members` - Society member master data

### Lending & Borrowing
- `loans` - Loans given to members
- `loan_transactions` - Loan disbursements and repayments

## Key Features by Module

### Day Book Requirements
- **Dual-column layout**: Receipt (left) | Payment (right)
- **Columns**: Voucher No, Society Voucher No, Particulars, Cash (â‚¹), Transfer (â‚¹), Total (â‚¹)
- **Automatic numbering**: Per day and per society
- **Daily cash balance**: Opening + Receipts - Payments = Closing
- **Validation**: Must balance before finalization
- **Exports**: PDF and Excel in exact format

### Voucher Creation
- **Multi-line entries**: Multiple debit and credit lines
- **Live balancing**: Real-time validation that debits = credits
- **Cannot save unbalanced**: System prevents saving until balanced
- **Link to members**: Optional member association
- **Maker-checker workflow**: Draft â†’ Verified â†’ Approved â†’ Posted

### Loans Module
- **Configurable interest**: Set rate at loan creation
- **Disbursement tracking**: Links to vouchers
- **Automatic repayment split**: Principal vs Interest
- **Outstanding calculations**: Running balances
- **Member-wise reports**: Loan status and schedules

### Borrowings Module
- **Similar to loans**: But from the society's perspective
- **Interest expense tracking**: Auto-calculated
- **Repayment schedules**: Simple interest basis

### Inventory Module
- **Item master**: SKU, Name, UOM, opening stock
- **Transactions**: Purchase, Sale, Adjustments (In/Out)
- **Stock ledger**: FIFO or Weighted Average
- **Valuation**: Automatic stock value calculation
- **Integration**: Sales/Purchases feed Day Book

### Reports Module
- **Ledger**: Account-wise transaction history
- **Trial Balance**: Must always balance
- **Profit & Loss**: Income vs Expenditure
- **Balance Sheet**: Assets vs Liabilities
- **Cash Book**: Cash and bank transactions
- **All reports**: Drill-down to source vouchers

## Security & Compliance

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- All tables have RLS enabled
- Users can only access data from their societies
- Role-based policies (Admin, Accounts, Auditor, Viewer)
- System functions enforce data isolation

### Maker-Checker Workflow
- **Draft**: Created by Accounts user
- **Verified**: Reviewed by another user
- **Approved**: Final approval (typically Admin)
- **Posted**: Immutable, affects reports
- **Cancelled**: Can be cancelled with audit trail

### Audit Trail
- Every critical action logged
- Captures: Who, When, What changed
- Immutable audit logs
- Complete traceability from reports to source

## Development Workflow

### Starting Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Adding New Modules
1. Create page component in `src/pages/`
2. Add route to `src/App.tsx`
3. Add navigation item to `src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx`
4. Use `useSociety()` context for current society data
5. Use `useAuth()` context for user information

### Database Queries Best Practices
```typescript
// Always filter by society_id
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('members')
  .select('*')
  .eq('society_id', currentSociety.id);

// Use maybeSingle() for zero-or-one results
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('account_heads')
  .select('*')
  .eq('code', 'A001')
  .maybeSingle();

// RLS automatically enforces society isolation
```
